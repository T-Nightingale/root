Some relatively impactful changes involving this brand new page. You can expect to see these whenever important changes are made to game modules.
Work was also done to re-do all deployment maps. I feel that with deployment zones, games begin quicker and slower armies are penalized less.
## Core Game
- Brand new game updates page: [Updates](https://battleforged.indiegamerules.com/updates).
- Updated all scenario maps with deployment zones (further updates to come later)
- Unified outflanking and ambushing in core rules
- Clarified deployment phase and other scenarios in core rules
- Updated terrain placement rules for terrain included in lists
- Critical(X) rule once again adds X to damage table rules instead of rolling multiple dice
## World War Two
- Added several new planes for Germany and United States (more to come on that)
- Updated several unit descriptions and moved longer ones into background "read more" modal
- Revised some faction strategies to be more useful
